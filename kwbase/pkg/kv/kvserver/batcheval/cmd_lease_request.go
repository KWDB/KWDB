		// receive an error under the new lease by making sure the sequence number
		// of that lease is higher. This in turn is achieved by forwarding its start
		// time here, which makes it not Equivalent() to the preceding lease for the

		// Note also that leasePostApply makes sure to update the timestamp cache in
		// this case: even though the lease holder does not change, the the sequence
